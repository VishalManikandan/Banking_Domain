# Banking Risk Analytics Report

## Problem Statement

This project aims to develop a fundamental understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services. The goal is to understand how data is utilized to minimize the risk of financial loss while lending to customers.

## Solution

We utilize Power BI dashboards to facilitate decision-making based on applicant profiles. The dashboards help determine whether to approve a loan based on the likelihood of repayment.

## Dataset Overview

The dataset includes information about bank details and various client profiles, structured in multiple interlinked tables using primary and foreign keys. Key tables include:

- Banking Relationship
- Client-Banking
- Gender
- Investment Advisor
- Period

## Data Cleaning

- **Income Band Creation**: 
  - Estimated Income < 100,000 is categorized as "Low"
  - Estimated Income < 300,000 is categorized as "Mid"
  
- **Processing Fees Column**: 
  - A new column is created to define processing fees based on the fee structure.

## Calculated Functions

### Common Functions

- **Sum**: 
  - Syntax: `Sum = SUM(<column>)`
  - Example: `Bank Deposit = SUM('Clients - Banking'[Bank Deposits])`

- **DistinctCount**: 
  - Syntax: `DISTINCTCOUNT(<column>)`
  - Example: `Total Clients = DISTINCTCOUNT('Clients - Banking'[Client ID])`

- **Sumx**: 
  - Syntax: `SUMX(<table>, <expression>)`
  - Example: `Total Fees = SUMX('Clients - Banking', [Total Loan] * 'Clients - Banking'[Processing Fees])`

- **Switch**: 
  - Syntax: `SWITCH(<expression>, <value>, <result>[, <value>, <result>]â€¦[, <else>])`

- **DATEDIFF**: 
  - Syntax: `DATEDIFF(<Date1>, <Date2>, <Interval>)`
  - Example: `Engagement Days = DATEDIFF('Clients - Banking'[Joined Bank], TODAY(), DAY)`

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- **Total Clients**: Represents the total number of clients in banking.
- **Total Loan**: Information about bank loans, business lending, and credit card balances.
- **Total Fees**: Total amount charged by the bank for various services.

## Visualization and Results

Dashboards include:

- Home
- Loan Analysis
- Deposit Analysis
- Summary Dashboard

## Conclusion

Power BI dashboards are powerful tools in the banking sector, providing valuable insights into key banking metrics and KPIs.

## Future Work

Future enhancements include:

- Analyzing total loan amounts and client distributions across different banks.
- Identifying trends related to client demographics and their banking preferences.
- Providing insights into various account types and the amounts involved.
